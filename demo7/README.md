# Demo 7: Approximate PI

This simple demo approximates the number PI through pixel data of drawn circles. The user can draw circles by clicking shift and the mouse and dragging it on the black region and send it to be added to the training set. When sending a drawing, the user actually sends the radius (in pixels) as input and the number of bright pixels as label or output.
